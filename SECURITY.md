# Security Policy and Guidelines

## üîí Security Overview

This document outlines the security policies, procedures, and best practices for the SendApi project. We are committed to maintaining the highest security standards to protect our users and their data.

## üö® Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. **DO** email security issues to: security@sendapi.com
3. **DO** include detailed information about the vulnerability
4. **DO** provide steps to reproduce the issue
5. **DO** include any relevant code or configuration files

### What to Include in Your Report

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if available)
- Your contact information

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Measures

### Dependency Security

We use multiple tools to ensure dependency security:

- **Safety**: Checks for known vulnerabilities in Python packages
- **pip-audit**: Audits dependencies against vulnerability databases
- **Automated scanning**: Daily vulnerability scans via GitHub Actions
- **Dependency updates**: Regular updates with security patches

### Code Security

Our code undergoes rigorous security analysis:

- **Bandit**: Python security linter for common vulnerabilities
- **Semgrep**: Static analysis for security patterns
- **Pre-commit hooks**: Automated security checks on commits
- **Code review**: All changes require security review

### Authentication & Authorization

- Secure password handling with bcrypt
- Session management with secure tokens
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting on API endpoints

### Data Protection

- Encryption at rest for sensitive data
- Secure transmission with TLS/SSL
- No hardcoded secrets in code
- Environment variable management

## üîß Security Tools

### Automated Scanning

```bash
# Run all security checks
make security-scan

# Run individual checks
make safety      # Dependency vulnerabilities
make bandit      # Python security issues
make semgrep     # Static analysis
make pip-audit   # Package vulnerabilities
```

### Pre-commit Hooks

```bash
# Install pre-commit hooks
make pre-commit

# Run manually
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Local Development

```bash
# Install security tools
make security-install

# Run security scanner
python scripts/security_scan.py --check all
```

## üìã Security Checklist

### Before Committing Code

- [ ] Run `make security-scan`
- [ ] Check for hardcoded secrets
- [ ] Validate all inputs
- [ ] Sanitize all outputs
- [ ] Use secure random generators
- [ ] Avoid unsafe deserialization
- [ ] Enable SSL verification
- [ ] Use parameterized queries

### Before Deploying

- [ ] All security tests pass
- [ ] No critical vulnerabilities
- [ ] Dependencies are up to date
- [ ] Secrets are properly configured
- [ ] SSL certificates are valid
- [ ] Access controls are in place
- [ ] Logging is enabled
- [ ] Monitoring is active

## üîç Security Monitoring

### Automated Monitoring

- Daily vulnerability scans
- Dependency update notifications
- Security issue alerts
- Performance monitoring
- Error tracking

### Manual Reviews

- Weekly security audits
- Monthly penetration testing
- Quarterly security assessments
- Annual security training

## üìä Security Metrics

We track the following security metrics:

- Number of vulnerabilities found
- Time to fix security issues
- Security test coverage
- Dependency update frequency
- Security incident response time

## üöÄ Security Best Practices

### Code Security

1. **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize user input
2. **Output Encoding**: Encode output to prevent XSS attacks
3. **Secure Random**: Use cryptographically secure random generators
4. **Avoid Eval**: Never use `eval()` or `exec()` with user input
5. **SQL Injection**: Use parameterized queries
6. **Path Traversal**: Validate file paths
7. **Hardcoded Secrets**: Use environment variables

### API Security

1. **HTTPS Only**: Require HTTPS for all communications
2. **Authentication**: Implement proper authentication
3. **Authorization**: Check permissions for all operations
4. **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse with rate limits
5. **Input Validation**: Validate all API inputs
6. **Error Handling**: Don't expose sensitive information in errors

### Dependency Security

1. **Regular Updates**: Keep dependencies updated
2. **Vulnerability Scanning**: Scan for known vulnerabilities
3. **Minimal Dependencies**: Only use necessary packages
4. **Trusted Sources**: Only install from trusted sources
5. **Version Pinning**: Pin dependency versions

## üîê Secret Management

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Example .env file (DO NOT commit to version control)
API_KEY=your_api_key_here
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@localhost/db
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
```

### Secure Storage

- Use environment variables for secrets
- Never commit secrets to version control
- Use secure secret management services
- Rotate secrets regularly

## üö® Incident Response

### Security Incident Process

1. **Detection**: Identify and confirm the incident
2. **Assessment**: Evaluate the scope and impact
3. **Containment**: Isolate affected systems
4. **Eradication**: Remove the threat
5. **Recovery**: Restore normal operations
6. **Lessons Learned**: Document and improve

### Contact Information

- **Security Team**: security@sendapi.com
- **Emergency**: +1-XXX-XXX-XXXX
- **GitHub Security**: Use private security advisories
